Hi!

I am Gilberto and work as an assistant professor at Federal University of Bahia, located at the sunny capital city of  Bahia (a Brazilian's northeast state) --  Salvador.

This is my personal website. I has used it to deliver slides, class notes and suplementar material to my students, and sometimes I post some R code and something that catch my attention at Research's tab.

I like books and movies of scientific fiction, and I have supported and helped to build a better society where all contradictions of capitalism were overcame and all human begins are free and completely emancipated. I has joined my local union, and I think you should do the same!

> From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
